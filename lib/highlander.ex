defmodule Highlander do
  @moduledoc """
  Highlander allows you to run a single globally unique process in a cluster.

  Highlander uses erlang's `:global` module to ensure uniqueness, and uses `child_spec.id` as the uniqueness key.

  Highlander will start its child process just once in a cluster. The first Highlander process will start its child, all other Highlander processes will monitor the first process and attempt to take over when it goes down.

  _Note: You can also use Highlander to start a globally unique supervision tree._

  ## Usage
  Simply wrap a child process with `{Highlander, child}`.

  Before:

  ```
  children = [
    child_spec
  ]

  Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  ```

  After:

  ```
  children = [
    {Highlander, child_spec}
  ]

  Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  ```
  See the [documentation on Supervisor.child_spec/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#module-child_spec-1) for more information.

  ## `child_spec.id` is used to determine global uniqueness

  Ensure that `child_spec.id` has the correct value! Check the debug logs if you are unsure what is being used.

  ## Globally unique supervisors

  You can also have Highlander run a supervisor:

  ```
  children = [
    {Highlander, {MySupervisor, arg}},
  ]
  ```

  ## Handling netsplits

  If there is a netsplit in your cluster, then Highlander will think that the other process has died, and start a new one. When the split heals, `:global` will recognize that there is a naming conflict, and will take action to rectify that. To deal with this, Highlander simply terminates one of the two child processes with reason `:shutdown`.

  To catch this, simply trap exits in your process and add a `terminate/2` callback.

  Note: The `terminate/2` callback will also run when your application is terminating.

  ```
  def init(arg) do
    Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)
    {:ok, initial_state(arg)}
  end

  def terminate(_reason, _state) do
    # this will run when the process receives an exit signal from its parent
  end
  ```
